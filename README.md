4. Compile production build: ```npm run prodbuild```
5. Run production build: ```npm run start```

#### Journey log...because, science:
1. Refactor React app into React/Redux app. See what the pitfalls and pickups are. Code cleaned up a lot, moving into logical containers.
2. Relearn data flow with Redux and 1 shared state/source of truth
3. Immutable JS - brain melting learning hurdle at times, but worth it
4. Refactor tests for Redux and move into TDD. Testing became more extensive, but made sense.
5. Combined reducers
6. Flow actionCreator pattern with action and payload
7. How components hook into Redux store with react-redux
8. Wrapping my brain around presentation and behavior separation
9. Introduced to using object literals rather than if/else and switch statements
10. More soaking in docs, ecosystem, community
11. Server side rendering and production build
12. Integrating Bootstrap in prep for other CSS frameworks
13. Constants file is a good thing
14. Directory structure - use it
15. React meet-up is a great thing
16. Trader Joe's Sparkling Lime Water makes me productive
17. egghead.io and frontendmasters.com now have some of my $
